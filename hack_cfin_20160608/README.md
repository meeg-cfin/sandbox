# Inaugural Hack CFIN session

## Summary

The first inaugural communal hack session with the intent of was held on

**June 8th, 2016, at the CFIN 5th floor meeting room, 9-16**

The session was well-attended (15) and energetic. The general consensus was that a joint effort to improve and maintain documentation on the wiki was called for. In addition, github was adopted as the location of software development, as well as feature requests and error/bug reports (via _Issues_).

### New Wiki-pages

* [A new M/EEG landing page](http://wiki.pet.auh.dk/wiki/MEEG_Landing_Page)
* [Getting started with analyses](http://wiki.pet.auh.dk/wiki/MEEG_Getting_started_with_analyses)
* [Database file access function for Matlab](http://wiki.pet.auh.dk/wiki/Matlab_search_STORM_DB_(database))

and a bunch of pages linked to by these. It was decided that wiki-pages related to MEG and/or EEG will be named with the prefix `MEEG ` to ease finding them via the wiki search box. It remains to be seen whether this is a good idea, _e.g._, whether separate `MEG` and `EEG` prefixes are called for.

### Code

* [Database file access function for Matlab](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/stormdb-matlab)
* [Example scripts for running pre-processing on MEG data using mne-python](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/pipelines/tree/master/mne-python)
* [New repository for Sarang's NEMOLAB](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/nemolab)

plus work on new cluster submission-functions for both command-line and python workflows (keep an eye out for it [here](https://github.com/meeg-cfin/stormdb-python))

### Next HACK CFIN?

Let the dust settle & make continuous improvements of new wiki pages. Arrange a new meeting after the summer. Use Wednesday-meetings without agenda to discuss how to move on with resource development.

## Intention

- improving documentation of workflows and pipelines for M/EEG data acquisition and analysis
- creating useful code for analyses & visualisation on the cluster
- creating teaching/learning materials for new user introduction
- increasing the social interaction within the M/EEG-crowd for the benefit of everyone

1. participants should reserve the whole day (ca. 9-4) for this
2. _everyone can contribute_: bring your questions and worries and we’ll not only find answers, but you will document them!
3. lunch & cake are very likely to happen

## Preparation

As the very first step in preparation, unless you already have one

## [Create a user account on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)

All M/EEG-related communal code development should happen in public, on github. You don’t have to worry about actually doing code development yet! However, things like bug reports and wish lists belong most naturally there (as “Issues”)—we will look at this on the 8th. (NB: some of you will be assigned to the task of documenting this routine on our internal Wiki, so perhaps a refresher of how to search and edit the wiki is also in place…).

## Create "Issues" for topics

Either something you'd like to contribute with, or something you miss/would like to have improved. [It's this simple](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)
