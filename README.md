# Getting started with M/EEG research at CFIN

This is a stepping stone-repo for new users (and new/unspecific ideas). Actual useful code will live elsewhere in the `meeg_cfin` organisation, and documentation should be written on the [internal wiki](http://wiki.pet.auh.dk/wiki) (link will only work while inside the DNC building).

## Things this repo can be used for

* A place to write ideas and wish lists (when you don't know where else to direct them)
* Learning to use `git` for code development (the clone-edit-pull request cycle)
* Planning "Hack CFIN" coding/documentation/hangout sessions
* add more here...
