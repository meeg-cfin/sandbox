# Inaugural Hack CFIN session

The first inaugural communal hack session with the intent of

- improving documentation of workflows and pipelines for M/EEG data acquisition and analysis
- creating useful code for analyses & visualisation on the cluster
- creating teaching/learning materials for new user introduction
- increasing the social interaction within the M/EEG-crowd for the benefit of everyone

will be held on

**June 8th, 2016, at the 5th floor meeting room, CFIN**

1. participants should reserve the whole day (ca. 9-4) for this
2. _everyone can contribute_: bring your questions and worries and we’ll not only find answers, but you will document them!
3. lunch & cake are very likely to happen

## Preparation

As the very first step in preparation, unless you already have one

## [Create a user account on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/)

All M/EEG-related communal code development should happen in public, on github. You don’t have to worry about actually doing code development yet! However, things like bug reports and wish lists belong most naturally there (as “Issues”)—we will look at this on the 8th. (NB: some of you will be assigned to the task of documenting this routine on our internal Wiki, so perhaps a refresher of how to search and edit the wiki is also in place…).

## Create "Issues" for topics

Either something you'd like to contribute with, or something you miss/would like to have improved. [It's this simple](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/)

## Program/Agenda

TBA

## Registration

Closed (send mail to Chris if you still want to join).
